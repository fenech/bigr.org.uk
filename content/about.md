First formed in 2010, a band with far too many Richards than is healthy (hence Big R Big Band), discovered a shared love of playing classic Big Band music, in particular the swing music of the 30's and 40's. Now well established across the country as one of the best swing dance big bands you can hear the music of Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman, and many many more.</p>
