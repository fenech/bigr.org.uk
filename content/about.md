Drummer Richie Paradise and sax player Richard Thomas combined a shared love of
classic swing big band music to put together a new big band based at the Cube
Cinema using the soya yoghurt dregs (as opposed to the cream) of the Bristol
Jazz scene. The first rehearsal took place in May 2010 and included a
disproportionate multiplicity of Richards, hence "Big R Big Band". Set lists
include renditions of classics by the likes of Count Basie, Dizzy Gillespie,
Duke Ellington, Buddy Rich, plus a motley collection of others..</p>
